The data sets to be reviewed are obtained using the following steps: -All data sets contained in the MSTJCLxx member in the DD statement concatenation for IEFPDSI and IEFJOBS. -The data set in the PROCxx DD statement concatenation that are within the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The specific PROCxx DD statement that is used is obtained from the PROCLIB entry for the JOBCLASSes of STC and TSU. The following is what data sets the process will obtain for analysis: MSTJCL00 //MSTJCL00 JOB MSGLEVEL=(1,1),TIME=1440 //EXEC PGM=IEEMB860,DPRTY=(15,15) //STCINRDR DD SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR) //TSOINRDR DD SYSOUT=(A,INTRDR) //IEFPDSI DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //SYSUADS DD DSN=SYS1.UADS,DISP=SHR //SYSLBC DD DSN=SYS1.BRODCAST,DISP=SHR JES2 //JES2 PROC //IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, //DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 //ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) //HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) //PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR &lt;&lt;=== //PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* //HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER JES2 initialization parameter JOBCLASS PROCLIB entries JOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB data set that will be used in the access authorization process: SYS3.PROCLIB SYS2.PROCLIB SYS1.PROCLIB The following PROCLIB data set will NOT be used or evaluated: SYS4.USERPROC Recommendation for sites: The following are recommendations for the sites to ensure only PROCLIB data sets that contain the STC and TSO procedures are protected. -Remove all application PROCLIB data sets from MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedures. The customer will have all JCL changed to use the JCLLIB JCL statement to refer to the application PROCLIB data sets. Example: //USERPROC JCLLIB ORDER=(SYS4.USERPROC) -Remove all access to the application PROCLIB data sets and only authorize system programming personnel WRITE and/or greater access to these data sets. -Document the application PROCLIB data set access for the customers that require WRITE and/or greater access. Use this documentation as justification for the inappropriate access created by the scripts. -Change MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedure to identify STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets separate from application PROCLIB data sets. The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation: a. Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures. b. If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets. Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO. The following is an example of the JES2 procedure: //JES2 PROC //IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, //DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 //ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) //HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) //PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* //HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER c. Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters: JOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … d. Ensure that only system programming personnel are authorized WRITE and/or greater access to PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures."

Log files should have security that prevents anyone except the syslogd process and authorized maintenance jobs from writing to or deleting them. A maintenance process to periodically clear the log files is essential. Logging stops if the target file system becomes full. SYSLOG Daemon HFS Object Security Settings File Permission Bits User Audit Bits /usr/sbin/syslogd 1740 fff [Configuration File] /etc/syslog.conf 0744 faf [Output log file defined in the configuration file] 0744 fff The following represents a hierarchy for permission bits from least restrictive to most restrictive: 7 rwx (least restrictive) 6 rw- 3 -wx 2 -w- 5 r-x 4 r-- 1 --x 0 --- (most restrictive) The possible audit bits settings are as follows: f log for failed access attempts a log for failed and successful access - no auditing NOTES: The /usr/sbin/syslogd object is a symbolic link to /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/syslogd. The permission and user audit bits on the target of the symbolic link must have the required settings. The /etc/syslog.conf file may not be the configuration file the daemon uses. It is necessary to check the script or JCL used to start the daemon to determine the actual configuration file. For example, in /etc/rc: _BPX_JOBNAME='SYSLOGD' /usr/sbin/syslogd -f /etc/syslog.conf For example, in the SYSLOGD started task JCL: //SYSLOGD EXEC PGM=SYSLOGD,REGION=30M,TIME=NOLIMIT // PARM='POSIX(ON) ALL31(ON)/ -f /etc/syslogd.conf' //SYSLOGD EXEC PGM=SYSLOGD,REGION=30M,TIME=NOLIMIT // PARM='POSIX(ON) ALL31(ON) /-f //''SYS1.TCPPARMS(SYSLOG)''' The following commands can be used (from a user account with an effective UID(0)) to update the permission bits and audit bits: chmod 1740 /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/syslogd chaudit rwx=f /usr/lpp/tcpip/sbin/syslogd chmod 0744 /etc/syslog.conf chaudit w=sf,rx+f /etc/syslog.conf chmod 0744 /log_dir/log_file chaudit rwx=f /log_dir/log_file"

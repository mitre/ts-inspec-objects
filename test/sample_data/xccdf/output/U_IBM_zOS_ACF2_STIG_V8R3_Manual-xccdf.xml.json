Use this documentation as justification for the inappropriate access created by the scripts. - Change MSTJCLxx and JES2 procedure to identify STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets separate from application PROCLIB data sets. The following is a list of actions that can be performed to accomplish this recommendation: a. Ensure that MSTJCLxx contains only PROCLIB data sets that contain STC and TSO procedures. b. If an application PROCLIB data set is required for JES2, ensure that the JES2 procedure specifies more than one PROCxx DD statement concatenation or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. Identify one PROCxx DD statement data set concatenation that contains the STC and TSO PROCLIB data sets. Identify one or more additional PROCxx DD statements that can contain any other PROCLIB data sets. The concatenation of the additional PROCxx DD statements can contain the same data sets that are identified in the PROCxx DD statement for STC and TSO. The following is an example of the JES2 procedure: //JES2 PROC //IEFPROC EXEC PGM=HASJES20,PARM=NOREQ, //DPRTY=(15,15),TIME=1440,PERFORM=9 //ALTPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2BKUP) //HASPPARM DD DISP=SHR, //DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(JES2PARM) //PROC00 DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //PROC01 DD DSN=SYS4.USERPROC,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS3.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR //IEFRDER DD SYSOUT=* //HASPLIST DD DDNAME=IEFRDER c. Ensure that the JES2 configuration file is changed to specify that the PROCLIB entry for the STC and TSU JOBCLASSes point to the proper PROCxx entry within the JES2 procedure or JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions that contain the STC and/or TSO procedures. All other JOBCLASSes can specify a PROCLIB entry that uses the same PROCxx or any other PROCxx DD statement identified in the JES2 procedure or identified in the JES2 dynamic PROCLIB definitions. The following is an example of the JES2 initialization parameters: JOBCLASS(*) ACCT=NO, /* ACCT # NOT REQUIRED (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=01, /* DEFAULT TO //PROC01 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(STC) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … JOBCLASS(TSU) AUTH=ALL, /* ALLOW ALL COMMANDS (DEF.)*/ … PROCLIB=00, /* USE //PROC00 DD (DEF.)*/ … d.

The statute of limitations varies according to the nature of a crime. It may vary by jurisdiction, and some crimes are not subject to a statute of limitations. Apply the following guidelines to the retention of SMF data for all DOD systems: (a) Retain at least two (2) copies of the SMF data. (b) Maintain SMF data for a minimum of one year. (c) All WRITE or greater access authority to SMF history files will be logged using the ACP’s facilities.

Security functions are the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Operating systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from nonsecurity functions) in a number of ways, including through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Developers and implementers can increase the assurance in security functions by employing well-defined security policy models; structured, disciplined, and rigorous hardware and software development techniques; and sound system/security engineering principles. Implementation may include isolation of memory space and libraries. Operating systems restrict access to security functions through the use of access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. Privileged functions include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. ",

One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to create a new account. Notification of account creation is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the creation of operating system user accounts and notifies administrators and ISSOs that it exists. Such a process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously created and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes. To address access requirements, many operating systems can be integrated with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements.",

During initialization the TCP/IP stack uses fixed search sequences to locate the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA files. However, uncertainty is reduced and security auditing is enhanced by explicitly specifying the locations of the files. In the TCP/IP started task's JCL, Data Definition (DD) statements can be used to specify the locations of the files. The PROFILE DD statement identifies the PROFILE.TCPIP file and the SYSTCPD DD statement identifies the TCPIP.DATA file. The location of the TCPIP.DATA file can also be specified by coding the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable as a parameter of the ENVAR option in the TCP/IP started task's JCL. In fact, the value of this variable is checked before the SYSTCPD DD statement by some processes. However, not all processes (e.g., TN3270 Telnet Server) will access the variable to get the file location. Therefore specifying the file location explicitly, both on a DD statement and through the RESOLVER_CONFIG environment variable, reduces ambiguity. The systems programmer responsible for supporting ICS will ensure that the TCP/IP started task's JCL specifies the PROFILE and SYSTCPD DD statements for the PROFILE.TCPIP and TCPIP.DATA configuration files and TCP/IP started task's JCL includes the RESOLVER_CONFIG variable, set to the name of the file specified on the SYSTCPD DD statement.

Data origin authentication verification must be performed to thwart these types of attacks. Each client of name resolution services either performs this validation on its own or has authenticated channels to trusted validation providers. Information systems that provide name and address resolution services for local clients include, for example, recursive resolving or caching Domain Name System (DNS) servers. DNS client resolvers either perform validation of DNSSEC signatures, or clients use authenticated channels to recursive resolvers that perform such validations. This is not applicable if DNSSEC is not implemented on the local network.",

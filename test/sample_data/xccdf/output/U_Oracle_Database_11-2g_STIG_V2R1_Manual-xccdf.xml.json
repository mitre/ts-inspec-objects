In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data. REVOKE statement Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects. The following types of permissions can be revoked: Delete data from a specific table. Insert data into a specific table. Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table. Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table. Create a trigger on a table. Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table. Run a specified routine (function or procedure). If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and you want to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that you use for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows: REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED; Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table. Syntax for routines table-privileges include DELETE | INSERT | REFERENCES [column list] | SELECT [column list] | TRIGGER | UPDATE [column list] column list ( column-identifier {, column-identifier}* ) Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. You can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list. Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table. Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table. Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns. Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table. Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table. Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns. grantees { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] * You can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege. Restriction: You cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object. routine-designator { qualified-name [ signature ] } Cascading object dependencies For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends on is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if you have other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see \"SQL standard authorization\" in the Java DB Developer's Guide. Limitations The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement: Table-level privileges All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N. When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on. When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). Column-level privileges Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13. When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on. When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). Revoke examples To revoke the SELECT privilege on table t from the authorization IDs 'Maria' and 'Harry', use the following syntax: SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE t FROM maria,harry To revoke the UPDATE and TRIGGER privileges on table t from the authorization IDs 'Anita' and 'Zhi', use the following syntax: SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE, TRIGGER ON TABLE t FROM anita,zhi To revoke the SELECT privilege on table s.v from all users, use the following syntax: SQL&gt;REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC To revoke the UPDATE privilege on columns c1 and c2 of table s.v from all users, use the following syntax: SQL&gt;REVOKE UPDATE (c1,c2) ON TABLE s.v FROM PUBLIC To revoke the EXECUTE privilege on procedure p from the authorization ID 'George', use the following syntax: SQL&gt;REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE p FROM george RESTRICT"

Nevertheless, this should be verified by reviewing the relevant system views, along with the other items to be checked here.) Ask the DBA to review the list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within and external to the DBMS that access the database. The list should also include files, tables or settings used to configure the operational environment for the DBMS and for interactive DBMS user accounts. Ask the DBA and/or IAO to determine if any DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings/tables, contain database passwords. If any do, confirm that DBMS passwords stored internally or externally to the DBMS are encoded or encrypted. If any passwords are stored in clear text, this is a finding. Ask the DBA/SA/Application Support staff if they have created an external password store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use. Verify that all passwords stored there are encrypted. If a password store is used and any password is not encrypted, this is a finding. The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet: You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials. This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change. The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials. How Does the External Password Store Work? Typically, users (and applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password. For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias you entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string. The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store: CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com Enter password: password CONNECT salesapp@orasales Enter password: password CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17 Enter password: password In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. You could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string. However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials: CONNECT /@db_connect_string CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; you cannot create one connection string for multiple users. In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologin feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.",
        "fix": "Develop, document, and maintain a list of DBMS database objects, database configuration files, associated scripts, and applications defined within or external to the DBMS that access the database, and DBMS/user environment files/settings in the System Security Plan. Record whether they do or do not contain DBMS passwords. If passwords are present, ensure they are encoded or encrypted and protected by host system security. The following are notes on implementing a Secure External Password Store using Oracle Wallet: Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use, or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function. Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store. To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line: $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed. Configuring Clients to use the External Password Store: If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database. For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before. If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task: 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -create Enter password: password The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification. 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username Enter password: password For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system Enter password: password In this specification the wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME etwork\\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user. 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1. For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file: WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin) ) ) 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows: SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases. When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail. Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4. WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin) ) ) SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE SSL_VERSION = 1.2 (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)"

When a user logs out of an Oracle session gracefully or has the session terminated for an idle timeout or any other reason, the session is terminated, and the resources are returned to the system. Check with the DBA to see what mechanism is used to disconnect the session and what events the site uses to determine if a connection needs to be terminated. To test for timeout, open a connection and leave it idle for a period greater than the defined idle timeout setting enforced by the system. Then try to use the connection. If the connection is no longer active, then the mechanism deployed to terminate the connection is active and working.",
        "fix": "Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon user logout. Configure DBMS settings to terminate sessions upon the occurrence of any organization or policy-defined session termination event. - - - - - To configure specific session termination processes we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event. Below are some examples. Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter. You can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with \"alter profile\" statements: alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit connect_time 180000 sessions_per_user 2 ldle_time 1800; Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when you create users, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources. The syntax to create a profile follows: CREATE PROFILE LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters; Resource_parameters: [SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT] [CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT] [CPU_PER_CALL n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT] [CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT] [IDLE_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT] By setting resource limits, you can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. You can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time. The system resource limits can be enforced at the session-level, the call level, or both. The session-level is calculated from the time the user logs in to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed. Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If you need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), you should set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination. When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are: sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections. The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections. Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance. Turning-on expire_time To set up these advanced features, simply edit your sqlnet.ora file. If you are a beginner, follow this procedure: Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI. In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local &gt; Profile. From the list on the right hand pane, select General. Click on the Advanced tab. Next, enter the values for the fields or options you want to set. When you are finished, choose File &gt; Save Network Configuration to write your changes to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.) The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information. Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips. To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, you should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.) Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error."

If fields do not contain enabled constraints where required, this is a finding. - - - - - Oracle provides built-in processes to keep data and its integrity intact by using constraints. Integrity Constraint States You can specify that a constraint is enabled (ENABLE) or disabled (DISABLE). If a constraint is enabled, data is checked as it is entered or updated in the database, and data that does not conform to the constraint is prevented from being entered. If a constraint is disabled, then data that does not conform can be allowed to enter the database. Additionally, you can specify that existing data in the table must conform to the constraint (VALIDATE). Conversely, if you specify NOVALIDATE, you are not ensured that existing data conforms. An integrity constraint defined on a table can be in one of the following states: ENABLE, VALIDATE ENABLE, NOVALIDATE DISABLE, VALIDATE DISABLE, NOVALIDATE For details about the meaning of these states and an understanding of their consequences, see the Oracle Database SQL Language Reference. Some of these consequences are discussed here. Disabling Constraints To enforce the rules defined by integrity constraints, the constraints should always be enabled. However, consider temporarily disabling the integrity constraints of a table for the following performance reasons: - When loading large amounts of data into a table - When performing batch operations that make massive changes to a table (for example, changing every employee's number by adding 1000 to the existing number) - When importing or exporting one table at a time In all three cases, temporarily disabling integrity constraints can improve the performance of the operation, especially in data warehouse configurations. It is possible to enter data that violates a constraint while that constraint is disabled. Thus, you should always enable the constraint after completing any of the operations listed in the preceding bullet list. Enabling Constraints While a constraint is enabled, no row violating the constraint can be inserted into the table. However, while the constraint is disabled, such a row can be inserted. This row is known as an exception to the constraint. If the constraint is in the enable nonvalidated state, violations resulting from data entered while the constraint was disabled remain. The rows that violate the constraint must be either updated or deleted in order for the constraint to be put in the validated state. You can identify exceptions to a specific integrity constraint while attempting to enable the constraint. See \"Reporting Constraint Exceptions\". All rows violating constraints are noted in an EXCEPTIONS table, which you can examine. Enable Nonvalidate Constraint State When a constraint is in the enable nonvalidate state, all subsequent statements are checked for conformity to the constraint. However, any existing data in the table is not checked. A table with enable nonvalidated constraints can contain invalid data, but it is not possible to add new invalid data to it. Enabling constraints in the nonvalidated state is most useful in data warehouse configurations that are uploading valid OLTP data. Enabling a constraint does not require validation. Enabling a constraint nonvalidate is much faster than enabling and validating a constraint. Also, validating a constraint that is already enabled does not require any DML locks during validation (unlike validating a previously disabled constraint). Enforcement guarantees that no violations are introduced during the validation. Hence, enabling without validating enables you to reduce the downtime typically associated with enabling a constraint. Efficient Use of Integrity Constraints: A Procedure Using integrity constraint states in the following order can ensure the best benefits: Disable state. Perform the operation (load, export, import). Enable nonvalidate state. Enable state. Some benefits of using constraints in this order are: No locks are held. All constraints can go to enable state concurrently. Constraint enabling is done in parallel. Concurrent activity on table is permitted. Setting Integrity Constraints Upon Definition When an integrity constraint is defined in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement, it can be enabled, disabled, or validated or not validated as determined by your specification of the ENABLE/DISABLE clause. If the ENABLE/DISABLE clause is not specified in a constraint definition, the database automatically enables and validates the constraint. Disabling Constraints Upon Definition The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and disable integrity constraints: CREATE TABLE emp ( empno NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY DISABLE, . . . ; ALTER TABLE emp ADD PRIMARY KEY (empno) DISABLE; An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and disables an integrity constraint never fails because of rows in the table that violate the integrity constraint. The definition of the constraint is allowed because its rule is not enforced. Enabling Constraints Upon Definition The following CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements both define and enable integrity constraints: CREATE TABLE emp ( empno NUMBER(5) CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY, . . . ; ALTER TABLE emp ADD CONSTRAINT emp.pk PRIMARY KEY (empno); An ALTER TABLE statement that defines and attempts to enable an integrity constraint can fail because rows of the table violate the integrity constraint.

Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function. Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store. To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line: $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed. Configuring Clients to Use the External Password Store: If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database. For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before. If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task: 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\12.1.0\\db_1\\wallets -create Enter password: password The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification. 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username Enter password: password For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system Enter password: password In this specification: The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME etwork\\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user. 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1. For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file: WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin) ) ) 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows: SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases. When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail. Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4. Below is a sample SQLNET.ORA File with Wallet Parameters set: WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin) ) ) SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE SSL_VERSION =1.2 (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)"

Group authentication does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds. CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds. CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes. IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit. LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk. LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch). PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause. COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details. Password Parameters: Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes you can specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400). FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log in to the user account before the account is locked. PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If you also set a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If you omit this clause, then the default is 180 days. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, you must specify an integer for both of them. If you specify an integer for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME. For example, if you specify PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times. If you specify an integer for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password. If you specify DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If you have not changed the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED. If you set both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if you omit both parameters. PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If you omit this clause, then the default is 1 day. PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If you omit this clause, then the default is 7 days. PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but you can create your own routine or use third-party software instead."

If Oracle RMAN is deployed, execute the following commands to ensure that the evidence of the implementation of the backup policy includes validating that the files are restorable: Validating Database Files with BACKUP VALIDATE --You can use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to do the following: -- Check datafiles for physical and logical block corruption -- Confirm that all database files exist and are in the correct locations --When you run BACKUP VALIDATE, RMAN reads the files to be backed up in their entirety, as it would during a real backup. RMAN does not, however, actually produce any backup sets or image copies. --You cannot use the BACKUPSET, MAXCORRUPT, or PROXY parameters with BACKUP VALIDATE. --To validate files with the BACKUP VALIDATE command: 1. Start RMAN and connect to a target database and recovery catalog (if used). 2. Run the BACKUP VALIDATE command. For example, you can validate that all database files and archived logs can be backed up by running a command as shown in the following example. This command checks for physical corruptions only. BACKUP VALIDATE DATABASE ARCHIVELOG ALL; To check for logical corruptions in addition to physical corruptions, run the following variation of the preceding command: BACKUP VALIDATE CHECK LOGICAL DATABASE ARCHIVELOG ALL; In the preceding examples, the RMAN client displays the same output that it would if it were really backing up the files. If RMAN cannot back up one or more of the files, then it issues an error message. Validating Backups Before Restoring Them You can run RESTORE ... VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use. The database must be mounted or open for this command. You do not have to take datafiles offline when validating the restore of datafiles, because validation of backups of the datafiles only reads the backups and does not affect the production datafiles. When validating files on disk or tape, RMAN reads all blocks in the backup piece or image copy. RMAN also validates offsite backups. The validation is identical to a real restore operation except that RMAN does not write output files. To validate backups with the RESTORE command: 1. Run the RESTORE command with the VALIDATE option. This following example illustrates validating the restore of the database and all archived redo logs: RESTORE DATABASE VALIDATE; RESTORE ARCHIVELOG ALL VALIDATE; If you do not see an RMAN error stack, then skip the subsequent steps. The lack of error messages means that RMAN had confirmed that it can use these backups successfully during a real restore and recovery. 2. If you see error messages in the output and the RMAN-06026 message, then investigate the cause of the problem. If possible, correct the problem that is preventing RMAN from validating the backups and retry the validation.

An example of a group authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account. For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator. Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a group authenticator, this requirement will apply. There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information.

This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered.",

        "check": "Review application source code required to be encoded or encrypted for database accounts used by applications or batch jobs to access the database. Review source batch job code prior to compiling, encoding, or encrypting for database accounts used by applications or the batch jobs themselves to access the database. Determine if the compiled, encoded, or encrypted application source code or batch jobs contain passwords used for authentication to the database. If any of the identified compiled, encoded, or encrypted application source code or batch job code do contain passwords used for authentication to the database, this is a finding. The check would depend on the information provided by the DBA. In a default Oracle installation, all passwords are stored in an encrypted manner. Ask the DBA if they have created an External Password Store for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use. Secure External Password Store: You can store password credentials for connecting to databases by using a client-side Oracle wallet. An Oracle wallet is a secure software container that stores authentication and signing credentials. This wallet usage can simplify large-scale deployments that rely on password credentials for connecting to databases. When this feature is configured, application code, batch jobs, and scripts no longer need embedded user names and passwords. This reduces risk because the passwords are no longer exposed, and password management policies are more easily enforced without changing application code whenever user names or passwords change. The external password store of the wallet is separate from the area where public key infrastructure (PKI) credentials are stored. Consequently, you cannot use Oracle Wallet Manager to manage credentials in the external password store of the wallet. Instead, use the command-line utility mkstore to manage these credentials. How Does the External Password Store Work? Typically, users (and as applications, batch jobs, and scripts) connect to databases by using a standard CONNECT statement that specifies a database connection string. This string can include a user name and password, and an Oracle Net service name identifying the database on an Oracle Database network. If the password is omitted, the connection prompts the user for the password. For example, the service name could be the URL that identifies that database, or a TNS alias you entered in the tnsnames.ora file in the database. Another possibility is a host:port:sid string. The following examples are standard CONNECT statements that could be used for a client that is not configured to use the external password store: CONNECT salesapp@sales_db.us.example.com Enter password: password CONNECT salesapp@orasales Enter password: password CONNECT salesapp@ourhost37:1527:DB17 Enter password: password In these examples, salesapp is the user name, with the unique connection string for the database shown as specified in three different ways. You could use its URL sales_db.us.example.com, or its TNS alias, orasales, from the tnsnames.ora file, or its host:port:sid string. However, when clients are configured to use the secure external password store, applications can connect to a database with the following CONNECT statement syntax, without specifying database logon credentials: CONNECT /@db_connect_string CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSDBA CONNECT /@db_connect_string AS SYSOPER In this specification, db_connect_string is a valid connection string to access the intended database, such as the service name, URL, or alias as shown in the earlier examples. Each user account must have its own unique connection string; you cannot create one connection string for multiple users. In this case, the database credentials, user name and password, are securely stored in an Oracle wallet created for this purpose. The autologin feature of this wallet is turned on, so the system does not need a password to open the wallet. From the wallet, it gets the credentials to access the database for the user they represent.",
        "fix": "Design DBMS application code and batch job code that is compiled, encoded or encrypted, to NOT contain passwords. Oracle provides the capability to provide for a secure external password facility. Use the Oracle mkstore to create a secure storage area for passwords for applications, batch jobs, and scripts to use or deploy a site-authorized facility to perform this function. Check to see what has been stored in the Oracle External Password Store. To view all contents of a client wallet external password store, check specific credentials by viewing them. Listing the external password store contents provides information you can use to decide whether to add or delete credentials from the store. To list the contents of the external password store, enter the following command at the command line: $ mkstore -wrl wallet_location -listCredential For example: $ mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -listCredential The wallet_location specifies the path to the directory where the wallet, whose external password store contents you want to view, is located. This command lists all of the credential database service names (aliases) and the corresponding user name (schema) for that database. Passwords are not listed. Configuring Clients to use the External Password Store: If your client is already configured to use external authentication, such as Windows native authentication or Transport Layer Security (TLS), then Oracle Database uses that authentication method. The same credentials used for this type of authentication are typically also used to log in to the database. For clients not using such authentication methods or wanting to override them for database authentication, you can set the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter in sqlnet.ora to TRUE. The default value for SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE is FALSE, allowing standard use of authentication credentials as before. If you want a client to use the secure external password store feature, then perform the following configuration task: 1. Create a wallet on the client by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -create For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -create Enter password: password The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you want to create and store the wallet. This command creates an Oracle wallet with the autologin feature enabled at the location you specify. The autologin feature enables the client to access the wallet contents without supplying a password. The mkstore utility -create option uses password complexity verification. 2. Create database connection credentials in the wallet by using the following syntax at the command line: mkstore -wrl wallet_location -createCredential db_connect_string username Enter password: password For example: mkstore -wrl c:\\oracle\\product\\11.2.0\\db_1\\wallets -createCredential oracle system Enter password: password In this specification: The wallet_location is the path to the directory where you created the wallet. The db_connect_string used in the CONNECT /@db_connect_string statement must be identical to the db_connect_string specified in the -createCredential command. The db_connect_string is the TNS alias you use to specify the database in the tnsnames.ora file or any service name you use to identify the database on an Oracle network. By default, tnsnames.ora is located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory on UNIX systems and in ORACLE_HOME etwork\\admin on Windows. The username is the database logon credential. When prompted, enter the password for this user. 3. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the WALLET_LOCATION parameter and set it to the directory location of the wallet you created in Step 1. For example, if you created the wallet in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin and your Oracle home is set to /private/ora11, then you need to enter the following into your client sqlnet.ora file: WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora11/network/admin) ) ) 4. In the client sqlnet.ora file, enter the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameter and set it to TRUE as follows: SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE This setting causes all CONNECT /@db_connect_string statements to use the information in the wallet at the specified location to authenticate to databases. When external authentication is in use, an authenticated user with such a wallet can use the CONNECT /@db_connect_string syntax to access the previously specified databases without providing a user name and password. However, if a user fails that external authentication, then these connect statements also fail. Below is a sample sqlnet.ora file with the WALLET_LOCATION and the SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE parameters set as described in Steps 3 and 4. WALLET_LOCATION = (SOURCE = (METHOD = FILE) (METHOD_DATA = (DIRECTORY = /private/ora12/network/admin) ) ) SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE SSL_VERSION = 1.2 (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file \"Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf\" for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)"

Organizations need to have the flexibility to be able to define the automated actions taken in response to an identified incident. This includes being able to define a least disruptive action the application takes to terminate suspicious events. A least disruptive action may include initiating a request for human response rather than blocking traffic or disrupting system operation. In order to preserve availability, it is important for the DBMS to terminate suspicious events with the least disruptive action possible. If suspicious events are not terminated, an attacker may gain entry into the system; however, if the system overreacts to a suspicious event and takes an overly disruptive action, a Denial of Service (DoS) may occur.",

The inclusion of role is intended to address those situations where an access control policy, such as Role Based Access Control (RBAC), is being implemented and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions. Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications. The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions. Use of accounts configured with excess privileges may result in the loss or compromise of data or system settings due to elevated privileges that bypass controls designed to protect them.",

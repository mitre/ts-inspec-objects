For AD, there are multiple configuration items that could enable anonymous access. Changing the access permissions on the domain naming context object (from the secure defaults) could enable anonymous access. If the check procedures indicate this is the cause, the process that was used to change the permissions should be reversed. This could have been through the Windows Support Tools ADSI Edit console (adsiedit.msc). The dsHeuristics option is used. This is addressed in check V-8555 in the AD Forest STIG."

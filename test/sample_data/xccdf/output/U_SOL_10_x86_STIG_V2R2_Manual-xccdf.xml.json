If the X11 services are not required for the system's intended function, they should be disabled or restricted as appropriate to the user's needs. By default, sshd binds the forwarding server to the loopback address and sets the hostname part of the DISPLAY environment variable to “localhost”. This prevents remote hosts from connecting to the proxy display.",

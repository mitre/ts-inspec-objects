      "title": "For site-to-site VPN implementations, the L2TP protocol must be blocked or denied at the security boundary with the private network so unencrypted L2TP packets cannot traverse into the private network of the enclave.",
      "desc": "Unlike GRE (a simple encapsulating header) L2TP is a full-fledged communications protocol with control channel, data channels, and a robust command structure. In addition to PPP, other link layer types (called pseudowires) can be and are defined for delivery in L2TP by separate RFC documents. Further complexity is created by the capability to define vender-specific parameters beyond those defined in the L2TP specifications. The endpoint devices of an L2TP connection can be an L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 2 protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. Otherwise, it is an L2TP Network Server (LNS), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 3 (IP) protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. The specifications describe three reference models: LAC-LNS, LAC-LAC, and LNS-LNS, the first of which is the most common case. The LAC-LNS model allows a remote access user to reach his home network or ISP from a remote location. The remote access user connects to a LAC device which tunnels his connection home to an awaiting LNS. The LAC could also be located on the remote user's laptop, which connects to an LNS at home using some generic internet connection. The other reference models may be used for more obscure scenarios. Although the L2TP protocol does not contain encryption capability, it can be operated over IPsec, which would provide authentication and confidentiality. A remote user in the LAC-LNS model would most likely obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from the home network to ultimately use through the tunnel back to the home network. Secondly, the outer IP source address used to send the L2TP tunnel packet to the home network is likely to be unknown or highly variable. Thirdly, since the LNS provides the remote user with a dynamic IP address to use, the firewall at the home network would have to be dynamically updated to accept this address in conjunction with the outer tunnel address. Finally, there is also the issue of authentication of the remote user prior to divulging an acceptable IP address. Because of all of these complications, the strict filtering rules applied to the IP-in-IP and GRE tunneling cases will likely not be possible in the L2TP scenario. In addition to the difficulty of enforcing addresses and endpoints (as explained above), the L2TP protocol itself is a security concern if allowed through a security boundary. In particular: 1) L2TP potentially allows link layer protocols to be delivered from afar. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only, are less defended, and not as well-known, 2) The L2TP tunnels can carry IP packets that are very difficult to see and filter because of the additional layer 2 overhead, 3) L2TP is highly complex and variable (vender-specific variability) and therefore would be a viable target that is difficult to defend. It is better left outside of the main firewall where less damage occurs if the L2TP-processing node is compromised, 4) Filtering cannot be used to detect and prevent other unintended layer 2 protocols from being tunneled. The strength of the application layer code would have to be relied on to achieve this task, 5) Regardless of whether the L2TP is handled inside or outside of the main network, a secondary layer of IP filtering is required; therefore bringing it inside does not save resources. Therefore, it is not recommended to allow unencrypted L2TP packets across the security boundary into the network's protected areas. Reference the Backbone Transport STIG for additional L2TP guidance and use.",

The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for non-local and remote management of DoD information systems. Use of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved.

Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria may also violate the trusted channel rule set. When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA).

Unique session identifiers or IDs are the opposite of sequentially generated session IDs, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Unique session IDs help to reduce predictability of said identifiers. When a user logs out, or when any other session termination event occurs, the VPN gateway must terminate the user session to minimize the potential for an attacker to hijack that particular user session. This requirement focuses on communications protection for the application session rather than for the network packet.

Bidirectional authentication provides stronger safeguards to validate the identity of other devices for connections that are of greater risk. SNMPv3 supports authentication, authorization, access control, and privacy while previous versions of the protocol contained well-known security weaknesses, which were easily exploited. SNMPv3 can be configured for identification and bidirectional, cryptographically based authentication. A typical SNMP implementation includes three components: Managed device, SNMP agent, and NMS. The SNMP agent is the SNMP process that resides on the managed device and communicates with the network management system. The NMS is a combination of hardware and software that is used to monitor and administer a network. The SNMP data is stored in a highly-structured, hierarchical format known as a management information base (MIB). The SNMP manager collects information about network connectivity, activity, and events by polling managed devices. SNMPv3 defines a user-based security model (USM), and a view-based access control model (VACM). SNMPv3 USM provides data integrity, data origin authentication, message replay protection, and protection against disclosure of the message payload. SNMPv3 VACM provides access control to determine whether a specific type of access (read or write) to the management information is allowed. Implement both VACM and USM for full protection. SNMPv3 server services must not be configured on products whose primary purpose is not to provide SNMP services. SNMP client services may be configured on the VPN gateway, application, or operating system to allow limited monitoring or querying of the device from by an SNMP server for management purposes. SNMP of any version will not be used to make configuration changes to the device. SNMPv3 must be disabled by default and enabled only if used. SNMP v3 provides security feature enhancements to SNMP, including encryption and message authentication. Currently, the AES cipher block algorithm can be used for both applying cryptographic protection (e.g., encryption) and removing or verifying the protection that was previously applied (e.g., decryption) in DoD. The use of FIPS-approved algorithms for both cryptographic mechanisms is required. If any version of SNMP is used for remote administration, default SNMP community strings such as “public” and “private” should be removed before real community strings are put into place. If the defaults are not removed, an attacker could retrieve real community strings from the device using the default string.",

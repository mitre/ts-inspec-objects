Procedure: Examine the system to determine if the Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is installed: # rpm -qa | grep MFEhiplsm Verify that the McAfee HIPS module is active on the system: # ps -ef | grep -i “hipclient” If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed, check for another intrusion detection system: # find / -name &lt;daemon name&gt; Where &lt;daemon name&gt; is the name of the primary application daemon to determine if the application is loaded on the system. Determine if the application is active on the system: # ps -ef | grep -i &lt;daemon name&gt; If the MFEhiplsm package is not installed and an alternate host-based intrusion detection application has not been documented for use, this is a finding.

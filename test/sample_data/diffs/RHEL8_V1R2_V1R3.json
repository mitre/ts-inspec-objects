In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.\\n\\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.\\n\\nRHEL 8 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config the product of the values of \\\"ClientAliveInterval\\\" and \\\"ClientAliveCountMax\\\" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The \\\"ClientAliveInterval\\\" is a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The \\\"ClientAliveCountMax\\\" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client.

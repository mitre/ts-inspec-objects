Using only authorized software decreases risk by limiting the number of potential vulnerabilities. Verification of whitelisted software occurs prior to execution or at system startup.\n\nUser home directories/folders may contain information of a sensitive nature. Non-privileged users should coordinate any sharing of information with an SA through shared resources.\n\nRHEL 8 ships with many optional packages. One such package is a file access policy daemon called \"fapolicyd\". \"fapolicyd\" is a userspace daemon that determines access rights to files based on attributes of the process and file. It can be used to either blacklist or whitelist processes or file access.\n\nProceed with caution with enforcing the use of this daemon. Improper configuration may render the system non-functional.

As of 07-Dec-17 I have started using a process to version the hiera datafiles.

The process is as follows:

- The top of the hiera file should contain a 'Version' and 'Date' line. Like so:
  ---
  # Version: x.y.z
  # Date: DDMonthYY

- When changes are made to the hiera data update the version according to semantic
  versioning.

- Before doing a commit create a patch to be applied to already deployed files:
  - # git diff <hiera_file> > patches/<hiera_file>-vx.y.z.patch

- Add changes and patches to the git repo (git add --all)

- Commit as usual

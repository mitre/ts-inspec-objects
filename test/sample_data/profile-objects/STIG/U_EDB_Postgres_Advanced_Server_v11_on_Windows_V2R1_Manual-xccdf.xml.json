      "desc": "Database management includes the ability to control the number of users and user sessions utilizing a DBMS. Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks. This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts. The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in, or added to, the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note: it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means. The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, two might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but ten might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session. (Sessions may also be referred to as connections or logons, which for the purposes of this requirement are synonyms.) Note that by default if no connection limit is specified, when a Postgres database user is created it will be allowed to have an unlimited number of concurrent sessions. The EDB Postgres CREATE USER and the PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE sql commands, which are used to create database users, provide a CONNECTION LIMIT option for configuring the allowable number of concurrent sessions for a user. It is good administrative practice to use this option to set the connection limit when new users are created. However, if a user was created without a connection limit or if the assigned connection limit needs to be changed, the CONNECTION LIMIT option can be set using the ALTER USER and ALTER ROLE commands.",

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage. The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

If the organization does not employ an existing log management utility, the following example identifies one approach that may be followed to rotate EDB audit log files on Windows. Determine the maximum size of the audit log directory. For this example fix, assume the audit log directory must have a maximum size of 100MB. Divide the maximum size of the directory by 10 to determine the size of the log files for rotation. For this example, the audit log file size will be set to 10Mb. Perform the following steps to ensure that the audit log directory is never more than 90% full and the oldest logs are removed to make room for new logs: 1) Execute the following SQL statements to review current auditing related settings and to configure EPAS to generate a new audit log file when the current log file has reached the log file size determined above (10 Mb): -- List current EDB Audit settings SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name; /* * Note: If edb_audit is not set to 'csv' or 'xml', auditing is not enabled. * To enable EDB auditing, issue one of the following SQL statements: * * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'xml'; * * or * * ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit TO 'csv'; * */ -- Set edb_audit_filename parameter to ensure unique name for each log file that is generated ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_filename TO 'audit-%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'; -- Set edb_audit_rotation_size to desired maximum file size (e.g., 10 Mb) ALTER SYSTEM SET edb_audit_rotation_size TO 10; -- Reload configuration settings to put the updated settings into effect SELECT pg_reload_conf(); -- List current EDB Audit settings to confirm updates are in place SELECT name, setting FROM pg_settings WHERE category LIKE 'EnterpriseDB Audit%' ORDER BY name; 2) Using a text editor, create a Windows batch file with the following content: @ECHO OFF SETLOCAL SET \"targetdir=<Path to edb_audit Directory>\" SET /a retain=8 FOR /f \"skip=%retain%delims=\" %%a IN ( 'dir /b /a-d /o-d \"%targetdir%\\audit-????????_??????.xml\" ' ) DO DEL \"%targetdir%\\%%a\" GOTO :EOF 3) Replace \"<Path to edb_audit Directory>\" for \"targetdir\" variable in the batch file (3rd line) to correspond to the EDB audit log directory configured for your EPAS instance. Note that the EDB audit log directory is configured by the edb_audit_directory parameter. By default, the edb_audit_directory is set to \"edb_audit\", which results in an \"edb_audit\" directory being created under the EPAS cluster's data directory for audit logs if auditing is enabled. The location of the data directory for a running postgres instance can be found using the following command run from a Windows command prompt: psql -d <database name> -U <database superuser name> -c \"SHOW data_directory\" where, <database name> is any database in the EDB postgres instance and <database superuser name> is a database superuser. By default, a database named \"edb\" and a superuser named \"enterprisedb\" are installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). If default setting of \"edb_audit\" is used for the edb_audit_directory parameter, the path to the EDB audit directory would be <EDB Postgres data directory>\\edb_audit. 4) Update the \"retain\" variable in the batch file (4th line) to correspond to the desired minimum number of audit log files that should be retained in the directory. It should be set so that sufficient headroom is maintained in the directory for log files generated between runs of the batch file. 5) Save the batch file to a location that would be accessible to the Windows Task Scheduler. For this example, save the file to \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat\". 6) Using the Windows Task Scheduler, create a scheduled task to execute the Manage_EDB_Audit_Logs.bat file on a periodic basis. At a minimum, it is recommended that the task be scheduled to perform this action at least on an hourly basis. Depending on the various audit log settings and database activity, it may be necessary to configure the task to be run more frequently."

Weak algorithms can be easily broken and not validated cryptographic modules may not implement algorithms correctly. Unapproved cryptographic modules or algorithms should not be relied on for authentication, confidentiality, or integrity. Weak cryptography could allow an attacker to gain access to and modify data stored in the database as well as the administration settings of the DBMS. Applications, including DBMSs, utilizing cryptography are required to use approved NIST FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules that meet the requirements of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The security functions validated as part of FIPS 140-2 for cryptographic modules are described in FIPS 140-2 Annex A. NSA Type-X (where X=1, 2, 3, 4) products are NSA-certified, hardware-based encryption modules. Postgres uses OpenSSL for the underlying encryption layer. Organizations must obtain and use a FIPS 140-2 certified distribution of OpenSSL or build their own FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL libraries. EnterpriseDB has a FIPS 140-2 validated set of cryptographic modules for use with OpenSSL on Windows to meet this requirement for EDB Postgres Advanced Server deployments.

This requirement is usually a function of the design of the IDPS component. Compliance can be verified by acceptance/validation processes or vendor attestation. At all times, Postgres maintains a write ahead log (WAL) in the pg_wal/ subdirectory of the cluster's data directory. The log records every change made to the database's data files. This log exists primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system crashes, the database can be restored to consistency by “replaying” the log entries made since the last checkpoint. Under the covers, Postgres uses fsync system calls to help ensure that modified database information held in memory is written to disk. To support certain specialized use cases where crash recovery is not as important as system performance, Postgres provides an fsync parameter that can be set to \"off\" to disable the use of fsync.

If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted. -- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary. -- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them. -- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ -- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them. -- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use. -- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, and REVOKE will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly “Grant” (as a person's name), could also be valid input. -- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits. -- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer. -- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use. -- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation. -- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways.

Using Windows Explorer: Browse to the directory where the EDB log directory folder is located. Select and right-click on the folder, select \"Properties\", and select the \"Security\" tab. Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the folder. Using a Windows command prompt, the following command may be used to list file permissions: icacls \"<EDB log directory>\" icacls \"<EDB log directory>\\*\" Review the users and groups and permissions assigned to them for the file(s). Note: The above commands will list the permissions for all files and folders under the log directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file.

If the log_directory parameter is set to an absolute path, database logs have been configured to be written to that location. Next, determine ownership of the EDB audit directory folder. This can be done using Windows Explorer or via a Windows command prompt. Using Windows Explorer: Browse to the directory where the EDB audit directory folder is located. Select and right-click on the folder, select \"Properties\", select the \"Security\" tab, and select the \"Advanced\" button. Note the Value of the Owner field. Using the Windows command prompt, enter the following command, replacing <EDB Audit directory> with the correct path for the EDB audit directory: dir \"<EDB Audit directory>\" /Q /S Note: The above command will list all of the files and folders under the audit directory. To make the output of this command easier to review, it may be redirected to a text file. Review the system security documentation. If the owner listed for the folder and any of the files and subfolders in the EDB audit directory and its content is not the service account responsible for running the Advanced Server database service this is a finding.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled table permissions. When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access. Thus, subjects that have been granted access to information are not prevented from passing (i.e., the subjects have the discretion to pass) the information to other subjects or objects. A subject that is constrained in its operation by Mandatory Access Control policies is still able to operate under the less rigorous constraints of this requirement. Thus, while Mandatory Access Control imposes constraints preventing a subject from passing information to another subject operating at a different sensitivity level, this requirement permits the subject to pass the information to any subject at the same sensitivity level. The policy is bounded by the information system boundary. Once the information is passed outside of the control of the information system, additional means may be required to ensure the constraints remain in effect.

      "title": "The EDB Postgres Advanced Server must prevent non-privileged users from executing privileged functions, to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.",
      "desc": "Preventing non-privileged users from executing privileged functions mitigates the risk that unauthorized individuals or processes may gain unnecessary access to information or privileges. System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged. Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users. A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to: CREATE ALTER DROP GRANT REVOKE There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include: TRUNCATE TABLE; DELETE, or DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or DELETE without a WHERE clause; UPDATE or UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or UPDATE without a WHERE clause; any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal. Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these. In Postgres, a user or group role that has been granted the SUPERUSER privilege can perform any action in the database. As such, the SUPERUSER privilege should only be granted to a limited set of approved users. The SUPERUSER privilege can be assigned to a role when the role is created. It can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement. Postgres also provides the CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, REPLICATION, and BYPASSURLS privileges that can be granted to non-superuser roles to allow them to perform a limited set of privileged activities such as creating databases, creating user and group roles, managing replication slots, and bypassing row level security restrictions. Although not as all-encompassing as the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges must only be granted to users who are approved to perform these activities. Like the SUPERUSER privilege, these privileges can be assigned to a role when the role is created. They can also be assigned or removed from a role via an ALTER ROLE statement. The PostgreSQL CREATE ROLE documentation provides more information about these privileges. See: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html In addition to the SUPERUSER, CREATEDB, and CREATEROLE privileges, a user may be granted one or more default roles that provide access to certain privileged capabilities and activities. A listing and description of the default roles provided with Postgres is documented at the following link: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html Roles and privileges on database objects can be granted to or revoked from a user using the GRANT and REVOKE statements. Users that are granted a role with the ADMIN OPTION can in turn grant the role to other users and roles. The ADMIN OPTION should only be granted to user and group roles that are approved to grant the roles. A description of the available privileges that may be granted to the different types of Postgres database objects is documented at the following link: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html Also in Postgres, for most object types, object owners can perform any action on the objects they own, including dropping or altering them and assigning or revoking privileges on them. As such, database objects should only be owned by users who are approved to own them. Another security risk to consider, is that Postgres can be extended with additional procedural languages that can be used to create user defined functions (i.e., not provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server out-of-the-box). Some of these languages, such as pl/Python and pl/R are defined as \"untrusted\" languages. Any users who are granted access to these untrusted languages are able to run user defined functions to escalate privileges and perform unintended functions. These languages allow a Postgres database to be extended with additional capabilities that may be of benefit to a system. However, usage of these languages should only be granted to approved users for documented and approved purposes.",

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Timeframes for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process. The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update.

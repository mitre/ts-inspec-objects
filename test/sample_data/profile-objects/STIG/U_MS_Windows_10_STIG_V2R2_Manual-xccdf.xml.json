All domain accounts must be enabled for multifactor authentication with the exception of local emergency accounts. Multifactor authentication requires using two or more factors to achieve authentication. Factors include: 1) Something a user knows (e.g., password/PIN); 2) Something a user has (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); and 3) Something a user is (e.g., biometric). A privileged account is defined as an information system account with authorizations of a privileged user. Network access is defined as access to an information system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, or the Internet). Local access is defined as access to an organizational information system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network. The DoD CAC with DoD-approved PKI is an example of multifactor authentication. ",

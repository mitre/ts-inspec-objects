Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks. This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts. The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means. The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

For example: host1[:port1] [host2:[port2] ... The default port number is 389, or 636 if SSL is enabled. 2) ENABLE_SSL - To enable SSL support, set ENABLE_SSL to TRUE (you must have the GSKit installed). This is an optional parameter; it defaults to FALSE (no SSL support). 3) SSL_KEYFILE - The path for the SSL keyring. A keyfile is only required if your LDAP server is using a certificate that is not automatically trusted by your GSKit installation. For example: SSL_KEYFILE = /home/db2inst1/IBMLDAPSecurity.kdb 4) SSL_PW - The SSL keyring password. For example: SSL_PW = keyfile-password 5) SECURITY_PROTOCOL - To enable TLS 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to TLSV12. To enable TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to ALL. By default, SECURITY_PROTOCOL is not set. This setting means TLS 1.2 is not supported. -- USER_RELATED values: 1) USER_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for users. Generally, set USER_OBJECTCLASS to inetOrgPerson (the user for Microsoft Active Directory) For example: USER_OBJECTCLASS = inetOrgPerson 2) USER_BASEDN - The LDAP base DN to use when searching for users. If not specified, user searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter. For example: USER_BASEDN = o=ibm 3) USERID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the user ID. The USERID_ATTRIBUTE attribute is combined with the USER_OBJECTCLASS and USER_BASEDN (if specified) to construct an LDAP search filter when a user issues a DB2 CONNECT statement with an unqualified user ID. For example, if USERID_ATTRIBUTE = uid, then issuing this statement: db2 connect to MYDB user bob using bobpass results in the following search filter: &(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=bob) 4) AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the DB2 authorization ID. Usually this is the same as the USERID_ATTRIBUTE. For example: AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE = uid -- GROUP-RELATED values: 1) GROUP_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for groups. Generally this is groupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames (for Microsoft Active Directory, it is group) For example: GROUP_OBJECTCLASS = groupOfNames 2) GROUP_BASEDN - The LDAP base DN to use when searching for groups If not specified, group searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter. For example: GROUP_BASEDN = o=ibm 3) GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP group attribute that represents the name of the group. For example: GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE = cn 4) GROUP_LOOKUP_ METHOD - Determines the method used to find the group memberships for a user. Possible values are: SEARCH_BY_DN Indicates to search for groups that list the user as a member. Membership is indicated by the group attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE (typically, member or uniqueMember). USER_ATTRIBUTE In this case, a user's groups are listed as attributes of the user object itself. This setting indicates to search for the user attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE to get the user's groups (typically memberOf for Microsoft Active Directory or ibm-allGroups for IBM Tivoli Directory Server). For example: GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = SEARCH_BY_DN GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = USER_ATTRIBUTE 5) GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE - Name of the attribute used to determine group membership, as described for GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD. For example: GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = member GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = ibm-allGroups NESTED_GROUPS If NESTED_GROUPS is TRUE, the DB2 database manager recursively searches for group membership by attempting to look up the group memberships for every group that is found. Cycles (such as A belongs to B, and B belongs to A) are handled correctly. This parameter is optional, and defaults to FALSE. -- MISCELLANEOUS values: 1) SEARCH_DN, SEARCH_PW If your LDAP server does not support anonymous access, or if anonymous access is not sufficient when searching for users or groups, then you can optionally define a DN and password that will be used to perform searches. For example: SEARCH_DN = cn=root SEARCH_PW = rootpassword 2) DEBUG Set DEBUG to TRUE to write extra information to the db2diag log files to aid in debugging LDAP related issues. Most of the additional information is logged at DIAGLEVEL 4 (INFO). DEBUG defaults to false."

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

The security administrator can also grant EXECUTE privilege on these routines to another user. Run the following query to find out which users have SECADM authority in database: DB2> SELECT CHAR(GRANTOR,35) AS GRANTOR, CHAR(GRANTEE,35) AS GRANTEE, GRANTEETYPE FROM SYSCAT.DBAUTH WHERE SECURITYADMAUTH='Y' If GRANTEETYPE is 'U' and the authorization ID is not an ISSM authorized user, this is a finding. If the GRANTEETYPE is 'G', then all members of the external group identified by GRANTEE must be ISSM authorized users, otherwise this is a finding. If the GRANTEETYPE is 'R', then all members of the database role identified by GRANTEE must be ISSM authorized users, otherwise this is a finding. The members of a role can be found using this statement: DB2> SELECT CHAR(GRANTOR,35) AS GRANTOR, CHAR(GRANTEE,35) AS GRANTEE, GRANTEETYPE FROM SYSCAT.ROLEAUTH WHERE ROLENAME= <search role name> Run the following query to find out which users have execute privilege on SYSPROC.AUDIT_ARCHIVE, SYSPROC.AUDIT_LIST_LOGS, SYSPROC.AUDIT_DELIM_EXTRACT: DB2> SELECT * FROM SYSCAT.ROUTINEAUTH WHERE SPECIFICNAME LIKE 'AUDIT%' AND SCHEMA='SYSPROC' If non-ISSM authorized users have execute privilege on any of above three routines, this is a finding.",
        "fix": "Update the value SYSADM_GROUP to a group which has only members approved by the ISSM using the following command: $db2 update dbm cfg using SYSADM_GROUP <SYSADMIN GROUP> Remove users not approved by ISSM from SYSADM_GROUP group using operating system tools/commands. Revoke SECADM authority from non-ISSM users using the SQL statement: DB2> REVOKE SECADM ON DATABASE FROM USER <user name> Remove non-ISSM members using the following the following SQL statement: DB2> REVOKE SECADM ON DATABASE FROM GROUP <group name> Revoke SECADM from the group or role using the following SQL statement: DB2> REVOKE SECADM ON DATABASE FROM ROLE <role name> Revoke execute from unapproved users if they have execute on SYSPROC.AUDIT_ARCHIVE, SYSPROC.AUDIT_LIST_LOGS, SYSPROC.AUDIT_DELIM_EXTRACT using appropriate variation of Revoke (routine privileges) statement. Note: The audit facility provides the ability to audit at both the instance and the individual database level, independently recording all instance and database level activities with separate logs for each instance level audit. The system administrator (who holds SYSADM authority) can use the db2audit tool to configure audit at the instance level as well as to control when such audit information is collected. The system administrator can use the db2audit tool to archive both instance and database audit logs as well as to extract audit data from archived logs of either type. SYSADM authority is assigned to the group specified by the SYSADM_GROUP configuration parameter. Membership in that group is controlled outside the database manager through the security facility used on your platform."

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures: -- Allow strings as input only when necessary. -- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted. -- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary. -- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them. -- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */ -- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them. -- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use. -- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input. -- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits. -- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer. -- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use. -- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation. -- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways.

Extract the certificate you just created to a file, so that you can distribute it to computers running clients that will be establishing SSL connections to your DB2 server. For example, the following GSKCapiCmd command extracts the certificate to a file called mydbserver.arm: $gsk8capicmd_64 -cert -extract -db \"mydbserver.kdb\" -pw \"password\" -label \"myselfsigned\" -target \"mydbserver.arm\" -format ascii -fips 8.

Add the value SSL to the DB2COMM registry variable. For example: $db2set -i db2inst1 DB2COMM=SSL or $db2set -i db2inst1 DB2COMM=SSL"

You invoke GSKCapiCmd using the GSKCAPICMD command, as described in the GSKCapiCmd User's Guide. The path for the command is sqllib/gskit/bin on Linux and UNIX platforms, and C:\\Program Files\\IBM\\GSK8\\bin on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms. On 64-bit platforms, the 32-bit GSKit executable files and libraries are also present; in this case, the path for the command is C:\\ProgramFiles (x86)\\IBM\\GSK8\\bin. - Ensure PATH (on the Windows platform) includes the proper GSKit library path, and LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on UNIX or Linux platforms) include the proper GSKit library path, such as sqllib/lib64/gskit. The -stash option creates a stash file at the same path as the key database, with a file extension of .sth. At instance start-up, GSKit uses the stash file to obtain the password to the key database.

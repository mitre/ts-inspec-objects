      "desc": "Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read and easily compromised. Use of passwords for authentication is intended only for limited situations and should not be used as a replacement for two-factor CAC-enabled authentication. Examples of situations where a user ID and password might be used include: - When the user does not use a CAC and is not a current DoD employee, member of the military, or DoD contractor. - When a user has been officially designated as temporarily unable to present a CAC for some reason (lost, damaged, not yet issued, broken card reader) (i.e., Temporary Exception User) and to satisfy urgent organizational needs must be temporarily permitted to use user ID/password authentication until the problem with CAC use has been remedied. - When the application is publicly available and or hosting publicly releasable data requiring some degree of need-to-know protection. If the password is already encrypted and not a plaintext password, this meets this requirement. Implementation of this requirement requires configuration of FIPS-approved cipher block algorithm and block cipher modes for encryption. This method uses a one-way hashing encryption algorithm with a salt value to validate a user's password without having to store the actual password. Performance and time required to access are factors that must be considered, and the one-way hash is the most feasible means of securing the password and providing an acceptable measure of password security. Verifying the user knows a password is performed using a password verifier. In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. A more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random salt value as follows: H0 = H(pwd, H(salt)) Hn = H(Hn-1,H(salt)) In the above, \"n\" is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. \"Hn\" is stored along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares \"Hn\" with the stored \"Hn\". A salt is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically strong random value. Another method is using a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key. This requirement applies to all accounts including authentication server, AAA, and local account, including the root account and the account of last resort.

To meet this requirement, the information system must create trusted channels between itself and remote trusted authorized IT product (e.g., syslog server) entities that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. The information system must create trusted paths between itself and remote administrators and users that protect the confidentiality and integrity of communications. A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is most often used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC. However, applications that do not use a trusted path are not approved for non-local and remote management of DoD information systems. Use of SSHv2 to establish a trusted channel is approved. Use of FTP, TELNET, HTTP, and SNMPV1 is not approved since they violate the trusted channel rule set. Use of web management tools that are not validated by common criteria my also violate trusted channel rule set. When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA).

Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day restrictions on information system use. This capability is typically reserved for specific application system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional assurance. Based upon requirements and events specified by the data or application owner, the application developer must incorporate logic into the application that will provide a control mechanism that disconnects users upon the defined event trigger.

For distributed architectures (e.g., service-oriented architectures), the decisions regarding the validation of authentication claims may be made by services separate from the services acting on those decisions.

In general, pre-shared keys should not be used. However, the use of pre-shared keys may be appropriate for some closed environments that have stung key management best practices. Pre-shared keys may be appropriate for constrained environments with limited processing, memory, or power. If pre-shared keys are appropriate and supported, the following additional guidelines must be followed. Consult 800-52 for recommended pre-shared key cipher suites for pre-shared keys. Pre-shared keys must be distributed in a secure manner, such as a secure manual distribution or using a key establishment certificate. These cipher suites employ a pre-shared key for device authentication (for both the server and the client) and may also use RSA or ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) algorithms for key establishment. Because these cipher suites require pre-shared keys, these suites are not generally applicable to classic secure website applications and are not expected to be widely supported in TLS clients or TLS servers. NIST suggests that these suites be considered in particular for infrastructure applications, particularly if frequent authentication of the network entities is required. These cipher suites may be used with TLS versions 1.1 or 1.2. Note that cipher suites using GCM, SHA-256, or SHA-384 are only available in TLS 1.2.",
